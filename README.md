# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Model
This project contains a machine learning model and Streamlit web application to predict whether a loan application will be Approved or Rejected  based on user inputs like income, credit score, asset value, and more.

##  Features

- Built using **multiple machine learning algorithms**:
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Logistic Regression
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Random Forest (with GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning)
- Automatically selects the best-performing model (**Random Forest** in this case).
- Scales features using **StandardScaler**.
- Real-time prediction via an interactive **Streamlit** web app.
- Model performance (accuracy) is displayed.

##  Model Performance

| Model                | Accuracy (Test Set) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Logistic Regression  | ~98.2%              |
| SVM (Linear Kernel)  | ~98.0%              |
| Random Forest (Best) | ~99.8%              |

üëâ **Random Forest** was selected for deployment due to its superior accuracy.
